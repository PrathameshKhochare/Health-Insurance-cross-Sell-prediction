# Health-Insurance-cross-Sell-prediction
This is a note book of cross selling of health insurance customers on vehicle insurance product and using machine learning to predict whether a customer is interested or not in vehicle insurance.

# Background Information :
An Insurance company that provide Health Insurance to its customers,the company wants to know if its customers from the previous year would also be interested in purchasing vehicle insurance from them.In this case we will build a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

# Problem Statement:
* To improve the customer reach-out process, the insurance company wants to optimize its sales approach. Currently, many insurance workers spend a considerable amount of time meeting with prospective clients without any knowledge of the likelihood of the customer buying an insurance product. Therefore, the company wants to develop a model that can accurately predict the probability of a customer buying an insurance product, which would help the insurance workers to focus their efforts on the customers who are most likely to purchase a policy. This would ultimately save time and increase the efficiency of the sales process.

# Business Goals: 
* Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.
